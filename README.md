# Methodology and software for cosmology


> The COsmostatistics INitiative ([COIN](https://asaip.psu.edu/organizations/iaa/iaa-working-group-of-cosmostatistics/)), a working group built within the International Astrostatistics Association
([IAA](https://asaip.psu.edu/organizations/iaa/international-astrostatistics-association-overview
)), aims to create a friendly environment where hands-on collaboration between astronomers,
cosmologists, statisticians and machine learning experts can flourish. COIN is designed to
promote the development of a new family of tools for data exploration in cosmology. 


## Generalized Linear Models in Astronomy

Statistical methods play a central role  to fully exploit astronomical catalogues and an  efficient  data analysis requires astronomers  to go beyond the traditional Gaussian-based models. This projects illustrates the power of generalized linear models (GLMs) for astronomical community,  from a Bayesian perspective.  Applications range from modelling star formation activity (logistic regression), globular cluster population (negative binomial regression), photometric redshifts (gamma regression), exoplanets multiplicity (Poisson regression), and so forth.

## Analysis of Muldimensional Astronomical DAtasets (AMADA)

AMADA allows an iterative exploration and information retrieval of high-dimensional data sets. This is done by performing a hierarchical clustering analysis for different choices of correlation matrices and by doing a principal components analysis in the original data. Additionally, AMADA provides a set of modern visualization data-mining diagnostics. The user can switch between them using the different tabs.
