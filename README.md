# Methodology and software for cosmology
---

The COsmostatistics INitiative ([COIN](https://asaip.psu.edu/organizations/iaa/iaa-working-group-of-cosmostatistics/)), a working group built within the International Astrostatistics Association
([IAA](https://asaip.psu.edu/organizations/iaa/international-astrostatistics-association-overview
)), aims to create a friendly environment where hands-on collaboration between astronomers,
cosmologists, statisticians and machine learning experts can flourish. COIN is designed to
promote the development of a new family of tools for data exploration in cosmology.
